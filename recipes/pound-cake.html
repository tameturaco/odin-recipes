  <ul>
    <li>3 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 pound unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
    <li>6 extra large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 cup 1% milk</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12-cup fluted tube pan.</li>
    <li>Place sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl. Cream together using an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or a hand mixer, on medium speed, until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating for 45 seconds after each addition. Add vanilla extract and beat for 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add 1/2 of the dry ingredients to the butter and egg mixture, mixing on low speed, until just blended. Add 1/2 cup milk and beat on low speed until just blended. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula between each addition. Repeat with remaining dry ingredients and milk.</li>
    <li>Pour batter into the prepared baking pan, filling no more than 2/3 full. Smooth the top with a spoon or a spatula.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the cake is just starting to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 1 hour and 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 15 minutes before inverting onto a plate. Allow to cool completely before serving.</li>
