  <h1>Banana Bread</h1>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Banana bread is one of my favorites to make. It's usually really simple, but can also get really complex, and it's already really delicious.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>5 very ripe bananas</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup shortening</li>

    <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>

  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease 2 - 9x5 inch loaf pans. In a medium bowl, mash bananas and stir in the eggs until well blended. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In large bowl, beat shortening and gradually add sugar. Stir in vanilla and banana mixture. Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt; blend into batter. Add walnuts if desired. Divide between the prepared pans.</li>
    <li>Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.</li>
